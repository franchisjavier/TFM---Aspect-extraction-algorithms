@pamelawella is that what makes him look like that? have always wondered..:) #tweetdebate
Earmark spending has tripled over the last 5 years. Hasn't it been a Republican Administration for the last 7? #obamashot #tweetdebate

I really would like to see Obama & McCain actually engage each other,rather than just talking to the camera #current #tweetdebate
#tweetdebate -1 Obama for not answering earmark claim by McCain
#tweetdebate McPain: we're exporting jobs 'cause of hi biz taxes. NOT because of cheap labor? Oh geez...
McCain really believes earmarks got us into this mess and tax cuts will get us out of it? #tweetdebate
McCain - have you tried buying health insurance for $5000 a year? #tweetdebate
#tweetdebate looks like McCain can't make eye contact with Obama and respond directly to him. dang! there goes "my friends" again.
@current #current How can you give all those tax breaks and expect the economy to not go futher into the hole?

#tweetdebate we can handle banks over to the federal government, but not healthcare?
@current #current Spending got out of control under REPUBLICAN presidency.
#tweetdebate - McCain calls for all energy alternatives, including Nuclear!  McCain also says Climate Change.  Boo.
I think Obama miscalculated with not supporting a safe nuclear power program. #tweetdebate

McCain -2 for saying 'were winning in iraq' i'm pretty sure that's not true #tweetdebate
Not being mr congeniality is a BAD thing.  If your senate won't work with you, other countries won't and we need friends #tweetdebate
McCain -2 for not answering the question #tweetdebate
Why does McCain leep talking about Miss Congeniality when that's the title Sarah Palin won? #tweetdebate

Yes. Let's cut spending for everything EXCEPT our defensive contracts. Are you fucking kidding me? #tweetdebate
@current  Oh, there came the Osama card.  That would have been the perfect time for McCain to "accidentally" mess up his name.  #current
Facebook Blunt Jackson McCain -3 for total falsehoods and personal attacks #tweetdebate. http://tinyurl.com/43v3kc
#tweetdebate McPain STILL quibbling over definition of "strategy" and "tactic."
-1 mccain wtf is he talking about in Afghanistan? Ramble on old man #tweetdebate
I'm afraid Senator McCain doesn't know the difference between "succeed" and "exceeed." #tweetdebate
Obama should only interrupt McCain when McCain lies... oh, never mind, that would be more interruptions... # Current #debate08 #tweetdebate
@current  Oh, that brings up a good question.  How the hell can we afford wars that don't matter when we're broke?  #current
Why is that Obama calls McCain John all the time, but McCain never refers to Obama by his first name? #tweetdebate
#current #debate08 #tweetdebate Wow, can't anyone stop Mc's bald lies?
#tweetdebate #obamashot Obama has NOT said change yet. Should i return the tequila bottle?
@ceanders And he keeps smiling in a really passive pedophile way
@current  Do you realize how expensive military weaponry is?  For Christ's sake, can't we just fight our wars with propaganda?  #current
Agreed: Iran should've been the #1 focus. #tweetdebate
#tweetdebate Sen O brings up subject of Pakistan. McPain: Won't repeat mistake I regret enormously...washed our hands of region (after USSR)
McCain soundbite: You don't say that out loud! #tweetdebate
#tweetdebate It's the economy, stupid.
McCain but those freedom fighters were alquaeda -2 #tweetdebate
I must disagree with Obama - Iran is bigger threat than Al Qaeda #tweetdebate
McCain -2 for mischaracterizing Obama on Pakistan #tweetdebate
Maybe McCain will let Paliin handle Pakistan ... she met some world leaders the other day ... she's ready!! #current #tweetdebate #debate08
@current  Why do we care about Pakistan?  Because they have nuclear weapons?  Do they have stability?  #current
"You dont say things out loud!?" Core problem as Republican's #tweetdebate
Yep I agree I think that MCCAIN is twisting facts and making lies up about shit. #tweetdebate
McCain -1 for man crush on General Patraeus #tweetdebate
McCain is treating him like the man-child he is.  Obama needs to stop being so congenial if he wants to win. #current #tweetdebate #debate08
McCain sounds condescending to Obama; Obama sounds angry at times when refuting claims by McCain #tweetdebate
Obama finally called him John, not Tom nor Jim... #tweetdebate

why do I all of sudden don't care about Mccain's record? #current #tweetdebate
#tweetdebate Obama -3 for Pakistan comments; McCain -3 for smugness and downtalking to Obama. What happened to "I respectfully disagree?"
Reagan is why this country is in debt in the first place #tweetdebate
McCain -2 for naming dead soldier, cheap shot #tweetdebate
McCai -3 for telling shitty bracelet story. Don't waste my time John! #tweetdebate
Obama needs to explain anti-democratic comment (i.e. letting Musharraf take over after coup - average American not understand) #tweetdebate
Ok why is it when Mccain makes a point about something he backs it with a war story? #tweetdebate
#tweetdebate McCain -3 for pulling out all the stops on war vets when we know he supported the cutting of the VET benefits
mccain -1 pulling the emotional heart strings about making it all worth it  #current #tweetdebate
@current #current Oh here is where McCain tries to look human by bringing human interest into the debate. Looks trite and cliche

@janoss - why does McCain not look at Obama? Can you answer that one?
#tweetdebate I can't stand when people debate military strategy by bringing up personal soldier stories. Like McCain's doing.
@current how long is the delay?
-2 McCain +2 obama "mccain said you can "muddle thru" afganistan. #tweetdebate McCain sounds condescending and petulant
@current  Did Al Queda take down the economy?  Well, it is a coincidence that we are pissing away money indirectly as a result. #current
#tweetdebate: we drink everytime they say: Iraq, Bailout, Bush, Iran, Israel, allies, Global Warming, Toxic, Obama, McCain, "my friends"

#tweetdebate MCCain Iranians are putting lethal IEDs in Iraq.
McCain's gaffe: Iran has a lousy government. That's some good int'l diplomacy! #tweetdebate
so a holocaust caused by Iran is bad but what's happening in Darfur can be ignored? #tweetdebate
McCain mentions existentialism and the French in the same statement.  Irony.  #tweetdebate
#tweetdebate McCain: "Iranians have a lousy economy." Kinda like...us! Speaking of the economy... Why aren't they talking more about it?
-5 McCain: you're missing the lead questions and walking on way too many tangents... #tweetdebate #debate08

McCain -0.1 each time he smirks while Obama speaks. #tweetdebate
@janoss - at any rate (considering my bias), I'm seeing Mc as paperboard.

Less respected than four years ago - a major understatement! We don't even respect ourselves anymore! #current
Yes, reps are experts on torture. #debate08 #current
#current Obama - we need to go to Afghanistan and Pakistan...and he wants more troops...is he really a democrat?!
We are definitely less respected now in the eyes of the rest of the world. This celebrity election is not helping. #current
damn right we're not respected anymore. we need a president who's gonna restore our international credibility. #current
Obama keeps saying him & McCain r not different. I thought O said McCain is 3rd Bush term. If true, is O going 2 b a 3rd term 2? #current

The safer question is a joke. We are chasing our tails, after something happens. What is thought determines how the USA is treated #current
#current McPain: Reagan's SDI was major factor of ending cold war. Obama doesn't get that failing in Iraq will embolden enemy.
#current they would establish a base in iraq! then the league of superdemocracies would have to go in and battle them!
Iraq is lost give it up Mc Cain! #current
-1pt for McCain's attack. How can we fail in Iraq? We don't even know how to win there! #tweetdebate
If the terrorists think an attack will help McCain win, they will attack before the election. #current

#current Stop saying 'cold war' and 'holocaust' McCain, you just sound desperate and stupid.
@gesteves Right, ignoring them just gives them more room #current
Did Obama's mom not teach him any manners? He needs to wait his turn to speak. #current
Okay-we all know Obama wants us out of Iraq, say something new #current
How can you people think there is a difference between these two... Sounds like all the same BS to me. #current
Obama should be president. McCain should retire and collect social security. #current
#debate08 #current #tweetdebate McCain's talking point: Obama doesn't get it.  He's doing a good job of driving that message home.
mccain -1 when asked about our standing in the world goes back to missile defense and rides Reagan's coattails #tweetdebate
This, I think, has been a very disappointing debate.  I thought Obama would come off better, but he didn't shine this time. #current

Old Songbird McCain will take care of Vets...HA!!! #current
"I honestly don't believe that Sen. Obama has the experience or the knowledge..."  Wow, wow, wow.  So true.  Thanks, McCain #current
Vote for McBush! #current
 @gregmcneilly No Obama is just confused by McSames ignorance & duplicity. #current #debate08
McCain is a war man. He will ONLY TAKE CARE OF THE WAR interests.#current
LOL. If McCain takes care of veterans, how come he's voting against veteran bills all the time? #current
what about the GI bill u didnt vote for McCain...LIAR!! #current
McCain seems to keep falling back on saying, "Obama just doesn't get it."  Umm...He seems to get it to me.  #tweetdebate #debate08
McCain's teeth keep whistling... #current
McCain -3 calling Obama inflexible  That's the pot calling the kettle black #tweetdebate
McCain -2 for yet another instance of "a noun, a verb and POW" crutch  #tweetdebate

rt @jupiejupe    #current Obama is only talking to the pop vote Mc is talking to the elect vote GAME OVER sadly
Mc Cains gonna take care of the veterans?  he had his chance the last 8 years! #current
McCain must be awfully tired  --- He's been everywhere and done everything! #current
Come on people, say it with me "McSame Old, McSame Old" #current
Talk about clinging mindlessly to one stuck position...how about McCain's insistence on staying in Iraq? #current
If experience is what we've had for the last 8 years, I'll pass on it and take my chances.#current
Obama needs a new makeup artist...his concealer is the wrong color under his right eye #current
Mccain -1 getting tired? stuttering? #tweetdebate
McCain smirks like Bush #current
Does voting against the GI bill count as taking care of veterans, John? #current
#current #debate08 I hate it when they talk over each other... cat-fight anyone?
-2 for Mcain saying he'll take care of vets but voting against benefits for them. #tweetdebate
I want to fall asleep when you talk Mccain #current
Why cooperate with the rest of the world when we can just enslave it. #current
#current babs is mad.
McCain, you know veterans, and will take care of them, yet Veterans organizations consistently give you low ratings? #current
mccain -7 for admitting that he has been 'involved in' all major natl sec threats.  -2 more for "the new 9/11" aka georgia.  #tweetdebate
Johnny, fix your dentures. You're whistling. #current
McCain doesn't believe that Obama has the experience - but he believes that Palin does? #current #debate08
yeah...he (McCain) really cares about the veterans....that's why he's tried to help Walter Reed #current
Surge did not work. Iraq simply ran out of bomb making materials. #current
i still hate MaCain's tie!! #current
#current twennty some years of experience. or of sameoldsame old?
Broken record McCain #current
john mccain: "i'm afraid....to look people in the eye" #current
#current yes, yes McCain we all know that you are old.  Calling out judgement? Seriously, McCain?
#current  OMG- McCain is smirking just like Bush does!
#current #debate08 - Ok, let's make McCain the Sec'y of Vet Affairs... instead of President----!!!!!
If veterans know and love McCain like he says, why the veteran protests during his GOP speech? #current
mccain keeps whistling! haha #current
OBAMA, WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF FINANCIAL COLLAPSE, WAR, ENERGY CRUNCH...NOT A TIME FOR ON THE JOB TRAINING #CURRENT
@current So do we now stereotype people from other nations as enemies because they live in a certain country?  #current
Obama going back to his drunk father roots.  #current
-1 McCain for the on the job training card #tweetdebate
"i've been involved in... virtually every major security challenge in the last 20 years..." McCain just admit to being a terrorist? #current
I'm tired of your stories McCain #current
mcc is just harping on one or two things, he seems desperate to me.  He's not putting up anything new, no new ideas, just same old. #current
McCains tie is godawful. #current
This debate reminded me why I'm an independent. Disheartening. #current
#current McCain needs to retire, not take the hardest job on earth!
McCain is such a lying sack about Veterans affairs. You will NOT support them or are you going to flip flop on that now? #current
Grandpa McCain is going to take care of America?! #current
Obama claims national healthcare is a national security issue-liberal? #current
McCain has an ugly tie #current
WHEN is this going to end?!  I thought it was 90 min!!!  #debate08 #current gaaaaaaah
Obama Loses! Incompetence breads incompetence! Veterans? What do you care anti-christ? #current
I'm outta here. I hope Bill Maher watched the debate. Remember, Barack sucks at debating things, especially because he is stoopid. #current
who will take care of you mccain when you're in a nursing home in 2 years??? palin?  #current #debate08
McCain is a veteran and Obama has a father from Kenya? Dang. I didn't know that. Lets be more pedantic invoke apple pie #current #debate08
BOOO!  Stop trying to push the lack of experience BS McCain, your VP has less experience than my mom does in dealing with people. #current
Mccain is out of touch.  He is a broken record.  We need change NOW! #current
You don't need any "on-the-job training?" You are 72! What if you DIE?! Why Palin if you care about "on the job training?" #current
I pretty much just feel depressed after this.  I wish this election could just get over with. #current
McCain will take care of the veterans like they're little babies, he'll let them nurse from my wrinkly man boobs. #current
It ain't a popularity matter ya dummy It is national security #current
You don't need on the job training huh? Like Palin who will likely become President because you're not gonna make it. #debate08 #current
McCain plays the war hero card again!  #current
horrible dis to Obama mccain #current
#current #tweetdebate Conches, I have to agree.  It's sad
#current Too much Alien vs. Predator. "Whoever wins, we all lose."
I was wondering when he was going to pull the POW card... #current
We'd have Al Qaeda taken care of by now if it hadn't been for Iraq and oil interests #debate08 #current
Is it good that Obama is talking about Dad ? What next talking his Bro LOL #debate08 #current #debateok08 #mccainshot
McCain just dropped that ball after Obama was lucid about Iraq #current
i was a p.o.w blah blah blah #current
@downsokc  we have $9 trillion debt.  A little too much, eh?  #debate08 #debateok08 #current
I hate to say it, Obama lost this debate. He's played too much defense and allowed McCain to on the offensive all night. #current
"there he goes again being a poor pitiful vet #current"
There he goes, the POW card, he couldn't resist #debate08 #current
then why vote against them McCain you'd think a veteran would support vetrans! - but those in wheelchairs esp. suffer he does shit #current
there you go....I am a POW!! #current
Here we go! POW story again! #current
Ask McCain about PAVE SPIKE  he shut down the search for MIA and POW's!  #current
-1 pt for McCain. Keeps bringing up the veteran issue. Yes, we know you love the veterans and we know you'll take care of it! #tweetdebate
#current YEAH! final comments from mccain reference coming home from prison. Everyone take a shot!!
#current if McCain is so pro-veteran, why didn't he vote for the new G.I. Bill?
Now they're having a blinking contest. #debate08 #current
-1 McCain for dredging up the POW stuff, all he knows is war #tweetdebate
I thought McCain was busy dumping his first wife after he returned from Vietnam. #current
oh here we go again..  blah blah blah.. violins and sappy music.. thanks danny tanner #current
We're the land of opportunity, but we need the gov't to take care of us? Make up your mind. #current #debate08 #tweetdebate
McCain sucks.#current
POW MIA issue is not resolved until EVERYONE comes back! #tweetdebate -50 McCain
Both McCain and Obama are a joke! give me 30 min. and I can prove it, lol. (this is to u Current! i luvs my current :)  #current
Is it just me, or is Current being anti-McCain and not showing those comments? #current #debate08
#current all McCain talks about is war ... he is a war lover, a war monger  he would be a president of war
McCain managed to screw up this debate without any help from Palin.Isn't he sad about Bush screwing vets?. #current #tweetdebate #debate08
"when I came home from prison..." Have we heard that one before? #current
#current McPain: when I came home from prison...veterans...heal wounds of war... [that's all you need to know!]
#current #debate08 #tweetdebate wow ... never mentions that PoW issue does he... good thing he was never tortured (* according to US)
wait. MCCAIN JUST ADMITTED TO BEING IN PRISON!!!! What's the crime? are you allowed to be president if you're a felon? WOW. NEWS #current
#current it doesnt matter thay are all going to do what it takes to get there pockets full
McCain's veteran voting record is a disgrace. #current
I think McCain has had 4 strokes throughout this debate.  #tweetdebate
NUUUUUUU sudden death!!! #current
The bracelet/meeting a solder's Mother were low ploys. Talk about what you are doing. Don't use the grieving Mom to make a point #current
MCCain: Vote for me b/c i got fucked up the ass by the viet cong for 5 yrs....#current #debate08
And Sen. Obama finally drops the "my father was from Kenya, that's where I got my name" line. #current
ARRRRRRGGGGGGGHHHHH!!!! McCain is talking about being a POW again. Wow! #current
rt @Tiak McCain, you know veterans, and will take care of them, yet Vet orgs consistently give you low ratings? #current about a minute ago
I'm not trying to be mean here or say their a problem, but why is he constantly talking about verterans and not the public!? #current
Cannot *wait* to see Palin in the VP debates. It's gonna be hi-lar-ious! #current
#current    McCain does remind be a bit of Reagan.  I'm waiting for him to start talking about the Pacific Coast Highway.
Obama ia a liar.#current
Obama won't get any sleep tonight cause he'll be up all night long licking his wounds. Start to prepare for the next one. #current #debate08
THIS WAS POINTLESS. #current
hmm... expected more of Obama #current
I KNEW that McCain couldn't go the entire debate without mentioning being a PoW! #current
Oh, and the US is incapable of diplomacy when it won't back down on any issue #debate08 #current
Veterans, including myself, are continually being mistreated by an Administration you supported 90% of the time Senator McCain #current
Say Whaaat?  MCain fought to keep quiet the investigations of POW's, he didn't try to find them #current
"When I came home from prison" probably wasn't the best choice of words. #current
i knew he'd end with POW talk...sigh;.. #current
McCain clubs baby seals.... seriously. #current #debate08
#current #debate08 #tweetdebate Overall, crappy debate.  Obama needs to learn to punch harder and go direct for JM's throat.
#tweetdebate If Obama can't get his point in with McCain will he be assertive with foreign leaders?
some debate.  they both were duds.  #current #debate08
the moderator sucked. #current
mccain's a douchebag! #current #debate08
Hallelujah! It's over! What do you say we all vote for McCain as Miss Congeniality?!!! #tweetdebate
So I learned NOTHING NEW, how about you?#current
How appropriate: McCain is most qualified because he was once a Prisoner. Of War.  Noun, verb, etc. #current
john mccain does not care about black twitter'ers #current #debate08 #tweetdebate #mccainshot #obamashot
It doesn't matter who won, nothing got resolved tonight. #current
#current nobody wins the debate.  everyone came away with the same opinion they came in with.
RT  Michael_Lehman    #current #debate08 - Ok, let's make McCain the Sec'y of Vet Affairs... instead of President----!!!!
They make it sound like the government is responsible for everything, research, health care etc.  #current
see McCain snuck in the POW background! #current, #debate08, #tweetdebate
Did Sen. McCain talk of anything other than defense, veterans, and Sen. Obama this evening? No economy, education, healthcare, etc?#current
Obama exits stage with staged fakeness....what a creep! #current #debate08
#cnn is more than 30 second delay on "live" #current more real time.
McCain -3 for being so condescending yet not expounding details of his plans beyond "I know" #tweetdebate
@lindagoin Not the smoothest transition.
I will never agree with McCain on the war #tweetdebate
#current  McCain never looks at Obama... why is that/
McCain voted against a bill that would cover the total cost of college for vets. He supports them? #current
#current #debate08 Nice choreography of the criss-cross and the wife-hugs.  I hate politcs!
Still wouldn't look at Obama when they shook hands. Ass!  #current #debate08
 -5 McCain for saying he will take care of Vets why hasn't he since he has been in Washington forever #tweetdebate
Obama - outdebated... there's no room for gray/corrections in a debate #current
No! McCain was a POW!!! I missed that somehow #current
@kwilson9austin I live with a vet. No way in hell is he voting for McCain. #current #debate08 & you should hear him on Palin. Wowza

regardless of who won the debate tonight...we are the ones who lost #current #debate08
McCain won't even look Obama in they eye when shaking hands. He's so dismissive. What an old bastard. #current
Obama cites father's desire to come to USA-but he didn't stay #current
Is it just me or was this REALLY depresing as far as how #%*$@&'d up the world is right now? Sigh ... #current
Last two points were nothing more than stump speeches by both candidates. #current
#2019 #current when the economy of war didn't stop a recession but caused a depression.  good ol' '08
McCain -1 for overplaying veteran card one or two times too many #tweetdebate
all of that blinking has been shown to be the sign of a fibber, John. #current
Yea, pull out the sob story songbird McCain #current
Obama is a liar. #current
This Obama guy is seriously gonna wreck this country if he wins.  SCARY. #current

McCain is scared of Obama. #Current #debate08 #tweetdebate
@kathrynjones he's racist #current
#2019 #current what I wouldn't do to simply have to worry about a war and an economic depression. GEAS makes that look like the war on drugs
I didn't really hear anything new in this debate. Hope future debates won't sound like political news pundit speak, too. #current #debate08
#tweetdebate: McCain says he'll take care of veterans. Just not if it includes a GI Bill. McCain knows how to heal wounds of war? Not quite.
#current I am worried on the whole with both of our choices
#tweetdebate Mccain lost he sucks hope he does not become President
@MediaLizzy mccain also knows how to create wounds of war by advocating so much war and deploying troops unnecessarily #debate #current
You know McCain should just stand there and sing "Mr. Self Destruct" by NIN. #current
#current and now the anchors and pundits tell us what we should think
John, you voted against the Webb bill to pay for college education for veterans. #current
.i am on my knees praying for a stray bullet in johnnys direction...but no brave souls seem apt on playing g-d this evening. #current
The number one problem is that there is too much emphasis on retarded communication tech instead of things that matter. #current
McCain's wife has had some good work done-but man has she had *a lot* of it. #debate08
#debate08 #current did someone really just ask if mccain is a felon.  He was in pow camp you idiot
#debate08 Oh, man--why is C-SPAN2 covering the spin room crap--this is exactly what I HATE about mainstream news.
If we want real change in DC, vote out all Congresmen and Senators that have been in office over 12 years.  #current
@DominickEvans I have fears that you are right... that it runs so much deeper than any american admits
#debate08 Body language was a big issue for me. In a contentious meeting, would McCain ignore his adversary in the room?

#debate08 Sadly, I think Obama missed the point - this election is going to be more about connecting with the average than about leadership
This is not a time for on the job training. #current
#current Bob Barr Team: Clearly tonightâ€™s debate shows both McCain/Obama mean more spending/more government/ever present risks to taxpayers
Can't wait to watch the VP debate. I wonder if Palin will wear a diaper. She's liable to wet her pants  #debate08
@bessemerprocess #debate08  mccain was disrespectful?  Obama kept calling mccain john and not senator.  THAT's disrespectful
#debate08 Well that was uneventful, guess we will have to wait for tomorrow at UMW
Cindy McCain is GLOWING RED.  In a burn my eyes way. #debate08
I came into debate not wanting to vote for either.  I leave in the same state of mind. #current
@mamalogues you think mccain won #debate08? none of the many experts on CNN agrees with you. sorry...! #current
#current can we remove 10,000 votes from McCain/Palin every time one of them utters "maverick"?
#debate08 I'm hoping the spin coverage points out how condescending McCain was towards Obama, that was frustrating.
wow, Biden is talking but they won't let Palin? Why not? Sexist?? #tweetdebate
#tweetdebate how can you have a spending freeze.  That's ridiculous.
POW and he was no hero, he was just like thousands of others. Maybe if he ever kept his planes in the air....  #debate08
I'm out of this shit. #current #debate08
CBS observer compares McCain to Nixon. Yikes. #debate08
McCain came off very rude. If McCain acts this way in office, with his smirking and disdain, he will be no help to America's image. #current
Biden and Rudy... Why are they hiding Palin still? #current
mccain is weak on the economy, better @ warmongering & apparently is afraid of direct eye contact #tweetdebate
seems to me like Obama kind of fell apart there at the end. #current
#current #debate08 Okay, that seriously stressed me out.
Obamarossa's dress looks like puke #current
where the hell were the environmental issues (besides energy)? #current
Body Language of McCain = Idiot.  #debate08
#debate08 - Obama supports missle defense, but not ones that don't work.  Uh - you fund programs until they do work...
#current mccain or mcblinky
#debate08 Re: McCain's comment about short North Koreans: Those in glass houses shouldn't throw stones. (McCain is 5'7''.)
Obama didn't emphasize so many differences as he did agree with McCain's points. But both avoided the economic questions. #debate08 #current
#debate08: wow. Obama Camp Mgr Thinks Barry "Commanded" the Foreign Policy debate. Laughing so hard my sides hurt.
Not sure where McCain goes from here.  He's lost the week, the day, and then the debate.  #debate08 #mccain #obama
#debate08 - Tie goes to [front]runner, Obama. JM needs to step up policy distinctions; BO needs to be funnier, more zingers
Sooo... McCain is not afraid to meet with ANY world leader. However, he just proved will not be able to look them in the eye. #debate08

Will the frequent Obama "McCain is right" lines will haunt him later? Someone should remind him he can't get consensus in #debate08.
Doesn't anyone remember when McCain went to Iraq and made a fool out of himself?  #current
I tell ya what. I'll need a drink tonight after these debates. Please get Obama/Biden into office, no McCain/Palin #debate08

Time for the talking heads! #debate08
Eugene Robinson is right. Pointing out that you've been there forever, during all the crisis is not a winning point. #debate08

I don't really care who you think won if you've already chosen. Of course you think *your* guy won. Any undecided voters swayed? #debate08
This debate was completely surreal in the context of the current economic crisis.  #current
#debate08 Why does McCain freakin' say "What Senator Obama doesn't understand is" before EVERY response. wtf, what a jacka$$.
@scbalazs What do you mean "Obama was able to keep up?" McCain was nervous, stiff, and wouldn't look at Obama at all #debate08
William Bennet on CNN: How many times did Obama say 'John is right...'? That's a great point. Obama conceding to McCain. #debate08
meh.  disappointed with both obama and mccain tonight. #current
mccain: obama is stubborn like bush! what? #debate08
I did think the twitter make the debate more interesting #current #debate08 #tweetdebate

#current Offshore drilling is a bridge -- an expensive bridge

#debate08 WHAT?! The GOP doesn't send Palin to answer after McCain, but Guiliani? Is he the VP now?
Anyone who thinks McCain won the #debate08 is a total dweeb dingle cheese.  (he says like a true dorkus)
Guiliani is a twit #current
#debate08 FTW T. Boone Pickens again?  The hell?
WOW. Biden spoke with NBC, Palin declined and the GOP gave them Rudy instead. What a fucking tool. #current
#debate08 oh god, here comes Giuliani
lol @martinbowling I was thinking morse code #tweetdebate
Retweeting @alexashrugged "I agree with Sen. McCain" should be the line of the night #debate08 #current
Palin declined the invite to discuss the debate???  What, is she busy monitoring her Russian neighbors??  #current
#debate08 Deja Vu 2004. Kerry supporters were jumping in haste even after a poor performance by Kerry. 2008 same old with Obama!
Both candidates point blank said they would commit war crimes and break international law. God bless America. #debate08
noticing many misquotes from #debate on #current #twitter
O-Who Camp had lowered expectations to allow them to be happy with such a performance.  #debate08
#debate08 wtf giuliani in lieu of palin? Is this a test run for a vp candidate replacement
#debate08 Palin/Biden is on a Thursday?  Gimme a break, Thursday is the new Friday.  No one is gonna watch those 2 on a Thursday night.
Oooo the (R)s sent Giuliani to talk to NBC instead of Palin!!! That's embarassing. #current
@FakeObama08 Matt is out....but I heard Chevy Chase wants Palin anihilated! (SP?)  Yeah.....who?  Oh...the dude that played Fletch.
I wish Guiliani would just shut the hell up. #debate08
#debate08 NBC has Guiliani on.  OMG. maybe it's clint Howard. can't tell. How can they say anything when McCain picked Palin - a joke

@ch3ryl Because it's CNN for pity's sake. Asking them to be objective is like asking Amy Winehouse not to smoke crack.
McCain called for a spending freeze, Hillary called for a trade timeout. Both ridiculous ideas. Both will lose. #tweetdebate #obamashot
#debate08 - so what happened to Palin and why isnt she on instead of Juliani? oh, right...
It's official! We're sunk. #debate08
Here's some tolerance from the Left. Note the username and the ONLY person they're following. How adult. http://twitpic.com/ddr4  #debate08
So does anyone else feel like they didn't discuss the economy as much as they should have? #debate08
#debate08 honest question for McCainiacs -- what's the thinking on Palin being nowhere near a live camera right now?
Where's palin? Getting drunk in Philly. #current
starting to get annoying that the GOP is hiding Palin #debate08
#debate08 is it just me or was McCain awful tonight
Brian Williams can't believe Rudy is saying this stuff with a straight face. #debate08
@evolver That really bums me out.  The "clean coal" more than any of that other stuff.  frackity
So, did anyone else notice that McCain didn't look directly at Obama while addressing him for the most part? #current #debate08
thinks the crawl on FOX news is so slanted it's despicable.  #tweetdebate
Has Palin said anything unscripted on live television yet?  #current
#debate08 McCain at times comes off as a competent Senator, but _never_ presidential.
#tweetdebate Wait a minute. NBC invited Palin to respond about the debate and she declined? Minus 500 points to McCain for picking a coward.
Palin is with her neighbors Russia #current
#debate08 Major Garrett- Obama campaign feels they won the debate. what debate were they watching???
Where is Palin? Looks bad to put Giuliani up because you can't find your VP nom. #debate08

#debate08 It seems like every election Conservatives talk about decreasing spending. Does that mean we can decrease military spending?

@MercuryMetro #current yeah the Wife and I were both commenting on that. It's cause he's an ass.
@theebayk1d I find it very disrespectful when one doesn't either salute the flag, or put their hand on their hear when the Anthem is played.
if there's any one I hate more than McCain, its Guliani #debate08
My kids: they sure were both rude to each other. #debate08
NBC in the tank why would the McCain camp give em air.. no way #debate08 good for Palin
#debate08 if we get McC for prez, all our $$$ will go to the mid-east and the us will fall into 1000% inflation
#debate08 I guess Palin has been locked in a room until next week. She's gotta a lot of work to do with Professor Higgins.
#debate08 obama is pro missile defense? WTF?
@perinandy she can't speak without having a script; this is why they try to hide her as much as they can. #current
#debate08 McCain sounded like a rambleing Grandpa Simpson.  Lehrer is a crappy moderator.
I heard that Biden is too polite and will fare badly vis a vis Palin. #current
How can McCain say Obama is not experienced enough when Miss Congeniality is his running mate? #debate08
#debate08 Every expert/commentator has said exactly what they as a partisan have been saying. Their guy was good. The other was off his game
@Mamalogues #debate08 #current i know it must be hard for you that mccain sucks so badly. again...sorry. try voting for obama!
@NewsHour Thought Lehrer's questions were too general/not pointed enough: e.g., What about Iran? What about Russia? etc. #debate08

I'm offering my translation services: Creepy McCain smile while Obama speaks=Damn, Obama got me again! I'm screwed. #debate08
McCain kept saying "I know how to do this."  If he knows so much, he needs to explain how he knows and WHAT he knows.  #debate08
@sarking I disagree. I think McCain loses by showing up. #debate08
#debate08 - apparently all the cool guys are wearing bracelets right now. Important fashion tip there. Oh, also, the world's utterly fucked.
mccain avoiding eye contact reminded me of exactly what dubya did in the debates with kerry.is it a republican thing? #tweetdebate #debate08
New drinking game: Each McCain says (wrongly) "Sen. Obama doesn't understand"=take a shot. Each creepy McCain smile=chug. #debate08
Obama should start smearing and being ridiculous with dark shadow footage, because that's the only way to "win" in this country. #debate08
Dee Dee Meyers thought Obama did great job on showing how great leader he is. Hmm must have watched different one than she did #current
@lindagoin I started paying attention after you brought it up.  I didn't see him make eye contact once.
No need to make false claims about Obamas plan. I read it. talk about scary!!! #debate08
@tarheelcoxn that's it, right there. trying to get away with lying in the debate is no good. #debate08
Was B Obama's interromption or talking over J McCain a result of talk-show uncivility? #debate08 #current
RT @factoryjoe: I looked into McCain's eyes and saw a B, a U, an S and an H (add from me: but even more willing to lie to win?) #current

@MailOurMilitary me too!  and i hate instead of expressing opinions making personal attacks on the candidate
condescending - read: correct #debate08
@drthomasho what spin? Debate was a yawn fest where both played to their base.
#debate08 this was mccain's good shot to beat down obama and it doesn't look like that happened.
@msblog might be deaf, dumb, and blind.
@roadkillrefugee that was mcc's version of reagan's "there you go again" to carter in their debate #tweetdebate
@forever_trust Drives me crazy! #DEBATE08
#tweetdebate It's telling that a lot of post-analysis is focused on trying to figure out what Obama could have done better
@scbalazs Skipping around channels. David Gergen said McCain needed "big" win but didn't get it. Thanks for the @'s!
@CurlingRiver Why are you so ignorant? Your thinking and ideology are what drives this country in the ground #current
what is Sarah Palin going to show off as her "preciouses" in the VP debate? "I got a bra from a vetran of Iraq's wife...see!" #current
#current #debate08 When Obama stayed positive, his ratings shot up as soon as he went negative he dropped. He also looked fairly angry
Reports that Palin is out Moose hunting with her pregnant daugher somewhere near Russia #debate08
#debate08 golly gee, i wonder why they didn't have palin out spinning for mcsame? could it be because she's functionally retarded? PROBABLY!
@msblog I was wondering that. Just because you've been somewhere, doesn't make you an expert on foreign policy with that country #debate08
#debate08 Somewhere Sarah Palin is gently weeping as she watches the GOP crown Rudy Giuliani "Miss Post-Debate Spinner"...
#debate08 McCain: "No-one can be opposed to renewable energy. No-one" Reality: http://ut.ag/00kG1
Obama looked nervous and uncomfortable the entire time. #current #debate08
GOP is laughing all the way to the Diebold voting machines. It doesn't even matter if half their party can't stand their candidate! #current
Lindsey Graham sounds just like Mr. Rodgers. #current
just wants to say, my 14-year old observes: "McCain just acted crazy sometimes."  Yup. That about sums up #debate08 response tonight for me.
@seasonothebitch McCain owes us tax-payer funded liver transplants.
oy vey! already with the new campaign ads? #Debate08
@matttbastard but we've got to cut spending!
McCain: "Back in my day... when I was there in the 60s" Obama: "Lies, more lies, thats not true. LIES." #debate08
NBC has Biden on after the debate. Instead of Palin we get....Rudy. Its almost like McCain is hiding his VP nominee. How weird. #debate08.
#debate08 the cnn.com live reporter is awful! she is really informal and dumb!
#debate08 Impressive, McCain campaign already has a "John is absolutely right" ad out on YouTube. http://tinyurl.com/43n74w
McCain's new ad on Obama agreeing with him is horse crap.  It cut's out what he really said. #current
cw will be no clear winner, but that mccain didn't get the shakeup he wanted/needed (from both debate and campaign suspension) #tweetdebate
So I think they confirmed to stereotype -- confident, kind of condescending jock and brainy egghead. I vote egghead. #debate08
@seasonothebitch my friend, that's not change we can believing.
The worst part of all this is that what I think doesn't matter,the line on the debate cld be completely spun by tomorrow #debate08 #current
#debate08 So if McCain wins, I'm probably screwed since he only seems to care about veterans
Also, John seemed to be obsessed with slamming Obama and looked desperate. #current
#current Wow. You can see the republicans on this page just by looking for old white guy avatars.
Man, McCain's already got a post-debate ad up, http://tinyurl.com/43n74w #debate08
Obama just let McCain back into the race by not going for the jugular during that debate. #debate08
I hate watching presidential debates.  They just get me all anxious and freaked out!  Obama needs a better rhetorical strategy.  #debate08
#current Biden: who was right and who was wrong? John has been "dead wrong" about [everything]. John was wrong about strategy & tactics.
What's that used car salesman doing on CNN? Oh, it's Joe Biden. #debate08 #current
@fakejohnmccain John John John, I won't be respectful and call you "Senator McCain" even if you do #tweetdebate

#current - The only thing Obama doesn't understand, grampy gramps (my age) McCain, is the necessity of thinking like McCain.
#debate08 GOP pundits: "McCain! McCain! McCain!!!". Democrat pundits: "Obama! Obama! Obama!!!". Haaaa...  spin...  how useless...
Don't worry fellas.  You'll get work in four years when some other GOP schlep runs against Obama.  #debate08 #mccain #obama
#current Biden: "John doesn't even know the difference between strategy & tactics and he's lecturing Obama on it." Ha, ha...
#current Biden: John was on his strongest turf today and he lost. I think it's fatal. I hope Palin defends same position than McCain did.
I watched the debate as my civic duty but would rather have teeth pulled than watch the Veep debate.#tweetdebate

@cyn3matic Don't forget the candy-striper optical illusion deliberately distracting McCain tie #debate
also too bad Obama didn't mention "Keating Five" in that first part of the debate. #debate08
McCain full of long, windy, gasbaggery & short on policy. The end. #debate08 #momocrats
#debate08 watching Keith Olbermann dissing McCain's debate blunders. there's a number of them! can't wait for the factcheck!
#debate08 - larison: "McCain is starting to let his contempt for Obama show.  He keeps laughing like some sort of disturbed gremlin. " LOL
on the even, it was a draw. but for an overall subject that is supposed to be in mccain's pocket, he did pretty poorly. #debate08
McCain jokes about Bear DNA funding but Palin requested funds to study Harbor Seals WTF? #current #tweetdebate
If McCain vetoes every bit of pork, he'll be vetoing money for road and bridge construction, among other things. #debate08

As a Hillary Clinton fanatic, I thought maybe I wasn't properly listening to the primary debates. I was. Barack was again weak. #debate08
The transcripts are up people, let's get the facts straight and not add to the spin #DEBATE08
McCain & his party are the "existential threat". Goodbye, democracy and freedom. Imploding from the inside, like it always does. =( #current
How many times must each candidate blink while they speak??? #debate08
I don't think either debated graciously or well, frankly. Most of their time was spent re-defining each other's terms. #current
fox is showing undecided voters and asking them who moved them. -- 65/35 split for Obama - ouch. #debate08
I think that Keating5 is a dangerous topic, better suited for ads than a debate #debate08
They say Obama's professorial, but I've never heard so much revisionist >1950s American history as I did tonight from Doc McCain. #debate08
#debate08 The fact that they call it the "Spin room" should be enough reason to avoid listening to it at all costs.
@emilychang If Repubs dig up Nixon's moldy skeleton, vote to impeach, & put the remains in jail cell for 20 yrs, I'll consider it. #debate08
#debate08 What McCain doesn't understand is saying "What Omaba doesn't understand is ..." becomes a counterproductive insult after 20 times.
My day job is simplifying messages. I was cringing throughout. Barack talked too much. And was too esoteric. #debate08
McCain's solution to diplomacy is to not talk to the parties involved and have a New World Order that bosses the world. Brilliant. #current

Kissinger changes what he said about discussions with Iran in order to support his boy. #current
#debate08 McCain: "we send $700B to countries that don't like us." Fed Govt only sends $39B in foreign aid, his # is what we spend on oil.

@Imarilove Practice? He's had how many years in Washington to practice??
@AFashionista, really? Did he not mention that he's a war hero yet again? How's that good? #debate08

"Hack the debate was great" #tweetdebate #current
good debate, based solely on the points raised,i think Obama made it. #current

I think I will have fun making a video up with Obama saying John is right and Good Job John LOL #debate08 #current #debateok08
McCain dominated. That's all. #current

Obama wins. #current
YES. I can't hardly wait for the Vice Presidential debates! #current
I love the fact that Lehrer was able to tell the candidates to stay on topic. #current
mccain won in having an eye burning tie #current
Well, considering it was the foreign policy debate, I'd give the slight edge to McCain on this one. But VERY slight. #debate08 #current
#current Obama won.
#current i have to say mccain did really well.  bummed.  thing is, its clear that Obama is WAY smarter.
YAY! #Current Drink drink drink!!!
@BarackObama Good Job. #current!
that was RAD.  Nice job Current TV, nice job Twitter... nice job pundits!  #current #debate08
Awesome First Debate! #tweetdebate   Good job Obama!  The US should be the first nation to have 2 presidents at the same time
McCain won tonights debate but Obama was alright. Obama should have done better tonight though especially early with the economy #current
I'm very much looking forward to Obama's inauguration. It will be a great day for America. We've been through a long, dark tunnel. #current
Thanks you guys, everyone rocked. Join us next time for the VP debates on Oct. 2nd #current
Thay came in with game tonight #current
Yay! for non-dibating stuff :) #current
#tweetdebate Correction: The iPhone and Twitterriffic rock!!
Hmmmm, pretty uneventful debate.  No clear winner/loser.  Both sharp.  BTW, I like listening to David Brooks from NYT on PBS #current
Obama wins!!! #tweetdebate
McCain clearly won this debate, Obama is lacking in the depth of knowledge it takes to lead and be the U.S. president  #current #debate08
Good debate, a little boring but glad to see it anyway. #current
see you guys back here next week #current
@jowyang what was your tally? #tweetdebate
#current #debate08 the moderator really favored McCain...
#debate08 I'd say Obama led early on economic stuff, and finished strong, but McCain's strong middle gives him a slight win.
@JustinGunn GOod job to you and yours. That was the most debating I've done with people on politics since I lived in DC.
Gloria Borger.. Obama held his own on defense issues with McCain #current #debate08
McCain WINS!!!! #debate08
McCain just won this debate! Hands down! #comment  #debate08 #debate

Good debate. Job well done to both candidates! #current, #debate08, #tweetdebate
#debate08 waiting for palin vs biden.. oh  bring that on!
Hack the debate with twitter was pretty intersting. Has my vote. #current
Obama looked more presidential +2 #tweetdebate
#debate08 The first debate can be summed up very easily "Senator McCain is right!"
I rock with Obama. #current
Obama IS telling the truth!!!#current
Glad to hear CNN is fact checking the presidential candidates' comments. Will be interesting to see what they find. #current
Obama did a good job of relating the issues together instead of just focusing on one thing at a time #debate08
#current not sure who 'won' but Obama obviously came off as the more personable of the two. Still voting Obama :)
All in all- good debate! Candidates were fairly intelligent and mostly respectful. Didn't change my opinion, but glad I watched. #current
The real winner tonight was Jim Lehrer.  You can't say PBS people don't have balls. #debate08
Based on this, either candidate should be good. Impressed by both candidates. #debate08
Retweeting @mamikaze: @Krississippi being from a military family, I do not trust Mccain's itchy trigger finger on bit. #debate08
#current quite a civilised debate,didn't really expect that- both did quite well (im dutch, i wont have to vote) in making their points
Gergen:  McCain clearly has superior FP understanding... #current #debate08
#debate08 NBC hit it right on the head! There seems to be something about Obama that McCain just can't stand.
#debate08 People are saying Lehrer favored McCain... I thought he was supposed to be all liberal biased?
+3 Obama for saying "orgy of spending" #tweetdebate
Obama got a crisp start in the debate (gergen) #current #debate08
#debate08 #current  Fred Barnes -  It was a tie but McCain finished strongly.
given the debate topic McCain should have won, but i think Obama really caught up...maybe even surpassed the old guy #current
#debate08 Brokaw just said it best, "They both played to their constituencies well."
RT @UltraNurd: #debate08 I'd say Obama led early on economic stuff, and finished strong, but McCain's strong middle gives him a slight win.
#current #debate08 Barr:"The people of Iran have a strong free market view of Iran... but Iran has a history of participatory gov't"
@thePuck I am enjoying your editorial comments re: the debate. :D
Obama held is own on foreign policy (gergen) #current #debate08
"Lehrer reall is a great moderator #current"
Obama passed the test. #tweetdebate #current
#debate08 one thing we can agree on is these guys beat Bush & Kerry in a tag team any day.
I enjoyed that debate. thought it was smartly and hotly battled. personally it solidified my support for obama. #Debate08
Still voting Obama #current
@BarackObama You did AWESOME!!!!!!!!!
But overall - McCain was GREAT - very impressed, maybe I had low expectations but great lines & responses #debate08 #current
I feel like Obama came off as strong and explained why he chooses things. McCain just pushed msgs. #current
Undecided voters on my TV say Obama Wins! #current
For me, Obama won.  But then again, Obama was my choice in the primaries. #current #debate08
#current Does anyone think David Gurgen seems a little like Eeyore (not as much as Lieberman)? He says Obama demonstrated "knowledge."
The #debate definitely gave me clarity about the election.  I'm voting for Rufus T. Firefly. #debate08
I second that, @moritazul. Obama for me, #debate08
Power went out.  Barr is now answering questions.  Good answers re: Iran, Bush Doctrine, etc. #current
Wow FactCheck.org ahead of the game http://zi.ma/factcheck-wire it's faster than the speed of spin! #current #tweetdebate
@andreamercado I liked that both of them at least got into some specifics, which is more than I could say for Bush/Kerry in 2004 at any time
#debate08 no memorable moment in this debate. McCain has more policy experience but Obama appears knowledgeable and held his ground.
McCain is the sheriff - Bennett CNN #current #debate08
#current if this Twitter audience is voting, it seems that Obama will win.
CBSnews Nielsen "undecideds" - majority said Obama won this debate #debate08
@BarackObama  You did AWESOME!!!!!!!!!  #debate08
"I agree with Sen. McCain" should be the line of the night #debate08 #current
Yep. Still voting for Obama/Biden. #current
#current #debate08 Barr:"It is important to maintain landing rights, overflight agreements, so when a problem does come up that we"
BINGO Obama just showed this country what diplomacy looks like, it's been a long time. ITA - we are used to short snide remarks #debate08
#debate08 and mccain wins...more experience where it counts, more specific across the board. looking forward to palin-biden.
McCain sez Obama not fit/ready to be prez, but Obama just went toe to toe with him with substantive answers; a + for Obama #tweetdebate
RT @alexashrugged "I agree with Sen. McCain" should be the line of the night #debate08 #current
McCain definitely won. #current #debate08
Oh, how I cannot wait to watch the VP debate coming soon - that should be a fun night...#current
@hnoftall not according to cbs's polling of undecided voters, who went strongly for obama. #debate08
#debate08 #current Juan Williams - Obama on the offensive.  Obama wins on economics and McCain on foreign policy.
Would love to be working the 'spin room' tonight. McCain was on and was forceful without looking like a jerk. #debateok08 #debate08
interesting debate...who is going to take the election? #debate08
McCain looked the most presidential, that's for sure.  #debate08
@MandianaJones - yes it was very obvious.
#debate08 I liked McCain's use of historical context. Obama probably avoided that because when he says it, it's professorial.
End result -- both McCain and Obama appealed to their base. McCain was warrior like and Obama was Presidential  #debate08 Goodnight All
Going walking with @MisterRob now. Thanks #debate08 #tweetdebate http://election.twitter.com I enjoyed to commentary.
#current - I think McCain won even though I'm still voting for Obama
@BarackObama I don't care what McCain says, I think you understand. ;) #debate08
McCain/Palin 2008! #current #debate08
To watch what people said while the candidates were talking made it able to keep the attention better #current #debate08
@current Good job with the debate! It was interesting to see what everyone was saying. #current
#debate08 So whiie I feel that Obama could have fought back against the McC lies more, but overall I truly believe that Obama won tonight.
#debate08 @pamelalyn -- very cogent point.
Fact that an African American candidate went to Mississippi for a pres. debate & it was a non-issue speaks to how far we've come #current
@davidweiner Yes.  Uppercuts!  That's what I want in a debate.  Not condescending, patronizing namecalling taken like a gent.
THREE CHEERS FOR TWITTER! STAYING ALIVE DURING THE DEBATE! #debate08 #tweetdebate #current
A great debate for America, now back to the work to get credit markets back to healthy without creating more frivolous spending #debate08
I think McCain was very strong and won this debate #debate08
#current wow-ABC is doing a "fact check" of the debate. Great idea. They should post all their lookups online.
obama said "I agree with john" at least 8 times, fox news is reporting #debate08
#current Guillliani: "McCain gave Obama a lesson in foriegn policy." Those spin-meister work fast!
"would you like to have tea?" +5 for obama for being a smart a** #tweetdebate
That was fun. #current and #debate08 completely changes this debate season.
#debate08 I think the thing that most came out of this is that Obama looked more presidential
#debate08  mccain = yesterday's man!
Friends at the debate party tonight think that McCain hammering on earmarks/spending was great. "That's why we lost in 2006." #debate08

#winner #current Where Obama made strides is in sounding and feeling credible and Presidential, which many people haven't seen.
"John is right" Obama's defining phrase #current #debate08

#Current + Twitter was great way to watch the debate. If only Daily Show and Colbert were about to air to really put it all in perspective.

@davidweiner Obama was the gent.
@martinbowling mccain has a hard time suffering fools #tweetdebate
Wow, really good debate - I can't decide who actually won (if either), but Obama did a great job with "McCain's strong suit" #debate08
#current i think the 'mcC is right on...' by O is a good thing in itself, ofcourse each candidate has good points. not tactical, but true.
Great to see so many people engaged in the debates and election; regardless of party affiliation or candidate of choice.  #current
I think saying, "John is correct about..." along with "John, that's just not true." worked.  Obama seemed like the one in charge. #current
#debate08 @JohnMcCain has 954 Twitter Followers. @BarackObama has 86,312. Looks like @BarackObama won Twitter by a landslide.

McCain +3 for admitting that the US engaged in torture! #tweetdebate
@disavian I agree.  It's tough to see an old war horse like McCain take empty swipes.  He'll have his place back in the Senate when he loses
@jpippert The "I wore my tie that looks good on the radio" tie? Oh yes. Smooth move, McCain. #debate08
@ pavlicko you gained at least one follower from searching tweetscan for #debate08 and then drilling down to read your comments.
#debate08 Tweeting in front of the TV while watching the debate tonight with a cocktail was a hoot! Don't miss the next ones - with tequila!
I love Twitter.. the new bar on the top is neat- o http://election.twitter.com/#debate08. A trip to read in real time public opinion
All McCain has is lies why can't he just tell the American people the truth. #current
@stevenbjohnson he said "don't torture... ever again." pretty clearly. #debate08
@janoss - re: emotive - neither candidate has it, but I met Obama in Chicago...so I'm biased. Obama likes to meet eye-to-eye.
CNN played Kissinger's response proving McCains answer correct. #debate08
the debate was a draw.  I thought Mccain did come out slightly on top because he sounded more educated on the issues. good closing.#debate08

@lindagoin To be honest, I've never had much passion for Obama. I just can't stand McCain anymore.  Obama's been growing on me though lately
@janoss - So, IMO, Obama won in his eye-to-eye, direct points, and his mission. The differences were very clear tonight.
#current  Why the obsessions on both right and left with who won? Both candidates clarified their positions--the viewers were the winners.

@davidweiner Good question.  They both had some good lines, but McCain probably was more colorful.
#debate08 @drunnells agreed!
Obama said McCain was right on several issues! #debate08

McCain is more personable tonight than Obama.  Didnt expect that at all in the first 4 minutes of the evening.  +5 McCain #tweetdebate
#tweetdebate "its not the beginning of the end, but the end of the beginning..." very "known unknowns" language

McCain -1 initial answer about earmarks  Obama  +1 clear answer    #tweetdebate

I wonder if Lehrer would only be happy when they resort to fisticuffs #tweetdebate
Obama always looks at the camera or McCain...McCain is looking for his walker #tweetdebate
+2 Obama for counter arguments, -1 McCain avoiding issue after 2nd request #tweetdebate
+1 Obama - loopholes in business tax code that give corporations really low tax rate, much lower that figure quoted by McCain. #tweetdebate
@MaryTrigiani Lehrer is being a very good monitor. Too eager to have them 'engage each other.' shouldn't a debate be about engaging topix?

#tweetdebate Obama mentions "google for government" I wonder if McCain even knows what that is

#tweetdebate not convinced either of these guys are the answer.  talking points vs talking big.
@current  It feels like they are arguing the existence of fairytale.  This is more like Bible vs. Truth.  #current
BADDA BING BADDA BOOM! Obama just hit it #tweetdebate
@janoss - John can't address Obama directly - is that a sign of something? A blink, perhaps?
Obama +2 clearly "agreeing" with Mccain on .... and yet, rebuttal - what's going on now - better #tweetdebate
@KatyComeTrue  The word "festooned" is woefully underused. #tweetdebate
#tweetdebate I think it's a mistake to concede the surge issue. I don't think that the violence was reduced as a result of the surge
Excellent rhythm and passion from McCain...he's dominating the time, esp. in Iraq policy...Obama nervous and stumbling #current #tweetdebate
McCain -2 for twisting reality. Obama +2 for rebutting McCain with aplomb. #tweetdebate
Mr. Obama, please mention Meridith. Or Fannie Lou. Or Medgar Evers.  You are in *Mississippi*. Step into the light! #current #tweetdebate
@humanbeatbox :D! So true. I can see the ticket: Jim Lehrer & Judge Judy 2008. #debate08
#tweetdebate Obama is speaking in facts & details; McCain is speaking in soundbites. Guess which gets you on the news over and over again?
"You don't say that out loud" - McCain. Not sure if that's a good or a bad soundbite.  #current #tweetdebate
obama: war in iraq bad, war in afghanistan good. mccain: threaten pakistan bad, threaten iran good. #tweetdebate
I agree with Obamas view on Pakistan but he realy shouldn't say that publicly #tweetdebate
@current #current The war is important but they should be spending more time on the economy. More a universal issue we all are affected by
#tweetdebate  Obama --if Pakistan is unable or unwilloing to act we should take them out  ((whatt???)))
Obama -1 for personal attack. but it was a good one! #tweetdebate
Am I the only one having trouble following the ACTUAL DEBATE?? #debate08 #current #tweetdebate
#tweetdebate i dont know many Irish startups.... Ireland's a beautiful country though. I wanna go back.
@sarking He needs to beat that point in, as well as the hundred years remark. We've got video of both. #debate08 Go for it!
#tweetdebate comes down to "John's right..." vs. "Obama doesn't understand..."
@current #current I have your bracelet and see you one, although Obama did stutter a little bit.
@MaryTrigiani Certainly more John Edwards-like anecdotes
For those watching CNN: Borger +5 for waking up and voting. Castellanos -5 for touching the buttons too much. #tweetdebate #debate08
@knightopia The question is, would the head implode or explode? #current #tweetdebate
Mccain +1 ok on Iran stats - is it true? though #tweetdebate
#tweetdebate Obama +3 for clear explanations McCain -5 for misrepresentations & drama
@MaryTrigiani Not sure what that has to do with it ... but no, of course not. He's a married man...
@janoss - good point that Obama is trying to make eye contact with Mc. Mc. is blurring over notes...
So if mccain is president we will either have friends or people we are warring with ? #tweetdebate
@current #current Ooh  McCain invoked Reagan. TURN IT ON HIM OBAMA!
@shayera #debate08 #McCain was the one who laid out his "by 2013" speech! Bring it up, #obama!
@current  Israel is just a borderline, as long as people agree to tolerate each other, the lines and labels won't be needed.  #current
Its so hard to find good mods these days, this one is a-ok there have been better / worse .... #tweetdebate
Best lines so far... McCain: "I was never voted Miss Congeniality" (said twice, no less!) and Obama: "I have a bracelet, too!"  #tweetdebate
@current  I think nuclear energy is a necessary evil at this point.  We need to have it tied into green directly thought.  #current

rt @seasonothebitch  "Working with Joe Lieberman should not count as bipartisan." #current I'll sign off on that, too.
#debate08 #current  Obama  We need missile defense,  Another GOP theme.
Personally, I just think Obama is more level-headed and I would feel safer with him than McC. McC maverickism scares me #current
McCain definitely got his rear end handed to him tonight. Obama was simply on point in this debate. #current
I wish either candidate would talk about what a joke airport security is. #current
McCain is a wolf in sheep's clothing and Barack is poised and not attacking his opponent.#current
I hope a nuke doesnt come over the atlantic!#current
#current I hope the next debate is more exciting and less polite.
McCain shows that Obama is pretty wet behind the ears, and not ready to be President tonite well done #current
Obama <3's McCain, keep thanking him #current #debate08
U.S. respect abroad is the major security issue, Obama get's it, McCain doesn't! #current, #debate08
cnn current analyst tallies: Obama 70, McCain 71 #tweetdebate #current
Wish Obama had pointed out what an Old Washington Guard McCain is when he was telling all those "four score & seven years" stories. #current
#current #debate08 Yes, good points on both side, no clear winner.
Again - McCain is a Leader - going in the very wrong way.  Obama is a think-before-doing, which is what we need. VOTE OBAMA #Current
#debate08 #current shoulda had a drinking game including "ronald reagan"
ah, mccain's talking point..."sen. obama doesn't understand.."#current
#current disappointed that Obama did not "connect" more, can't believe McCain sounds more effective overall.
Obama won McCain just rambled #current
#current McCain looks like he could debate for another 2 hours. Obama looks like he needs a break.
i feel like i'm reading a shouting match on #current .  i think both candidates are having trouble communicating their ideas tonight
rt @RyuPlasticTree McCain is a wolf in sheep's clothing and Barack is poised and not attacking his opponent.#current
every other twitter i read says McCain won this debate. The other half say Obama won it. Go figure. #current #mccainshot #obamashot
Obama should be president. McCain should retire and collect social security. #current http://twurl.nl/li8j88
Obama is more calm. McCain is a tweaker  #current
Where does McCain get his "facts"? #current
#current Obama is only talking to the pop vote Mc is talking to the elect vote GAME OVER sadly
Obama just feels like his is telling the truth, McCain just seems like he is hiding a lot of information #current

Obama is getting high marks on the CNN "polygraph test," but he's not saying ANYTHING!  Again, are the American people infants?!?  #current
#debate08 #current Obama right about needing strong econ for strong nat'l defense. But the current bailout plan won't do it

Barack Obama: DEBATE REALITY CHECK: FACTCHECK ON COMMITTEE HEARINGS http://tinyurl.com/4ve7f2 #debate08 #current #tweetdebate
neither one of them really projects optimism in the way reagan or clinton did . . . to be fair, times are tough #current #debate08
I am not impressed with either candidate.  Obama doesnt get it, but his heart is in the right place.  #current
My imagination or does Barack get to speak on screen alone, and Mccain gets to share split screen with Barack giggling every time? #current
Everyone thinks their candidate won. If either could have shown a bracelet, it would have sealed the win. #current
It's simple, Mccain is wrong on the big issues and Obama was right.   #current
We don't need espionage if we don't make enemies around the world #debate08 #current
McCain hits with the "on the job training" bullet.  But Obama gave me a vision of hope, not of fear. #current #debate08
i'm all for taking care of the vets, but what about the rest of us? #current
Neither one, won this debate, They keep going around the point #current
McCain pulling a Hillary, saying Obama is not flexible enough, and he is....hah!  #current #debate08
I don't think anyone on has been swayed to the other side. Tweeters on #current are v. partisan (not that I'm any better).
Obama will help get America's credibility back. McCain will piss on it. #current
#current #debate08 no on the job training needed? wishful thinking. always be learning.
Poll on http://www.drudgereport.com/ shows McCain ahead, only indicates who reads the drudge report of course. #current #debate08
I think Obama won. Unfortunately I think America will think McCain won. #current
#current Obama had more substance, McCain had talking points
Oh.. I don't know - it's the end of the debate - and I'm still not impressed ugh! - just my back hurts & sleepy #tweetdebate
Uses his  POW card...knew he would...      #current

WOW.  I'll bet their are some POW/MIA families shooting their TVs right now. #current
because of the earmarks in the bill, not the bill itself #tweetdebate
McCain treated this like an interview with Lehrer instead of a debate. Can NOT wait to hear Palin V. Biden #current
Phils won.  Mets lost. #current
Can't wait to see the ending stats! #debate08 #current
I don't think anyone won. #current
thinks Cindy McCain will be voting for Obama. #tweetdebate
the verdict: an interesting first debate, but no conclusive winner as yet. #current
#current And we're off... Not sure about the 'winner'. Guess overall Obama was better. McCain really grew in this debate.
Seems like Obama was fighting out of the corner tonight. Stayed on defense.  He came off rude and dodgy.  McCain wins by TKO. #current
The most dangerous man in America, David Brooks, and Mark Shields are saying that the debate changed nobody's mind. True, I think. #current
#current Close call.  Too close to call?
Obama won on the economy. Tied on foreign policy issues. #debate08
#debate08 obama might have held his own, but mccain is a foreign policy dude. who knows who won.
#debate08 Mmmmm I think about it as a 50/50 .... not bad, waiting for the polls of tuesday!
@Marti_L I think both of them were uneven. Obama did OK, McCain swung from old grumpy/snipey to bland. #debate08
wow chris matthews says obama looked more presidential but might have given up too many points. #current #tweetdebate
#debate08 Overall impression: McCain consistently set the tone and subject of the debate topics, Obama was following and playing defense...
#debate08 Mostly a draw, don't think it swayed many people.
Good point King, this debate didn't say anything new to people who have been closely looking, but did talk to less informed people. #current
#current I thought Obama would do much better. I think he pulled his punches.
@lukemcneur Disagree mate. Obama was calm cool, and direct. McCain was floundering  #debate08
#debate08 Nice call from @dbrauer. Obama did hold his own. I guess maybe he gets the nod for a victory. Bar too low though. For Palin too
Debate results: McCain: 3 (Iraq, Iran and Russia) Obama: 2 (Afghanistan & Pakistan) #current #obamashot #mccainshot
It was an exciting debate, but I expected more blood. #current
McCain certainly looked better than expected, but with all the lies, I'm not calling it a win. Obama should have been less polite. #debate08
#debate08 I'm surprisingly sober.They must have totally trained the primary buzz words out of their systems.  No change this time my friends
given the debate topic McCain should have won, but i think Obama really caught up...maybe even surpassed the old guy #current
As much as I don't like Obama, he didn't do poorly. When you're in the lead, that's good. #debate08
#debate08 Felt like Obama was very strong in the beginning, but overall didn't have as many taglines as McCain that people will fawn over
#current there is no way we can pull out of Iraq, just ask the troops, do a poll on that
#debate08 I don't think anything was said tonight to move the election.
@usermac Truth be told, I'd be happy to have McCain or Obama as President. I just dont think we can afford 4 Republican years. #current
From the persoanl attacks from left on #current and #debate08 it is obvious McCain scored points over Obama
@kathrynjones he was raised in a time when racism was ok i love the old ppl in my family but they are racists 2 - its ingrained in that gen!
Yeah - I don't know why Obama didn't just cream him.  Is he worried that he'll lose points for being uncivil? #current
#debate08 #current Barr:"You don't jump over all of the intermediary steps that we, can, ought to begin... in diplomatic relations w/Iran"
It looks like Senator McCain won this debate. And Mrs. McCain wins the fashion debate. (What was Michelle thinking?) #debate08
#debate08 tie
Fox News thinks it was a good night for John McCain. Well, duh....  #debate08
Bill Kristol: McCain got under Obama's skin #current #debate08
#debate08 no KOs, or even knock downs
#debate08 Obama has the facts and vision, McCain has the catch phrases and blind single-mindedness to win this. Obama is missing the point
My Totals (and I'm a Democrat): McCain 12, Obama 6 -- Obama has a lot of work ahead of himself. #tweetdebate
#debate08 #current  Bill Kristol Maybe Obama won the first round but McCain won every other round.  Obama on the defensive.
I'm not buying the McCain win on FP. I think Obama is *right* about Afghanistan and Pakistan re Al Qaeda - #debate08
Yup.  Obama is the intellectuallay generous guy.  Too bad the American public would rather vote for the biggest dick. #current
@SarahInMI I am on Fox- I know someone in Az who might be on the local fox news there and she thinks it might be put in a national feed
#current is off the chain. Loving the comments and opinions of the masses.
Bill Bennett: How many times did Obama say "John is right" and how many times did McCain say "Obama is wrong"? #debate08 #current
Verdict: McCain exceeded all expectations.  BHO: flat.  #current #debate
#current Bill Bennett says Obama is "intellectually generous guy" but McCain was the "sherriff" and "masterful" cause he "knew the names."
Bill Bennett is right, McCain was firmer. More conviction. Good grasp of facts and figures. Obama tried to reframe things too much. #current
As angry as I got at McCain for his petty BS (ignoring Obama the whole time), it was a pretty even debate. Nice and unfriendly.  #debate08
Last year these debates used to be special, but with all those primary debates, this seems so regular to me #current #debate08
You don't "win" a debate in general unless you knock it out of the park. #current
Does Obama have to be on the attack to win a debate? I thought was he appropriate w/ shots but some think he wasn't tough enough? #debate08
#debate08 join the covert radio show forums to talk about the war on terror and security. http://is.gd/3chp
#debate08 Obama 1, McCain 0
#debate08 It did seem like Obama was constant agreeing with McCain.  McCain, however, not so nice.
@POttenhoff "JM needs to step up policy distinctions." Obama was agreeing with McCain time and again. #debate08 #current
McCain did well in the beginning, but Obama took over once foreign policy kicked in. #debate08
McCain looked better on a narrow set of issues; Obama looked more consistent across the board but didn't win big.  Close. #tweetdebate
#debate08 I think you have to give a slight edge to Obama, if for no other reason than McCain's "Don't Understand/Reagan" tired offense
a little brain numb from watching debate. I thought McCain did well at times. Obama-too much agreeing. #debate08
#debate08 Obama actually talked about the present...mccain just told a bunch stories.  Obama 1, McCain 0
#debate08 Well, it's clear Obama won on policy and principle, but McCain may have won on sound bites. Obama was too polite!
Twitter and #current debate very cool, would have been better if I bypassed sucky current signal and went straight to web. All and all A+
Katie, you're beautiful...but Wrong!#current
@FakeObama08 Kind of makes you long for the days when President Roosevelt just got on TV and told you what was going on...no sugar coating!
#current Now Guilliani on NBC. He laughs...ha, ha, ha... when Brian Williams says Biden called McCain "wrong" about Iraq.
Uhh. Palin didn't give a response to the media when Biden did? That really doesn't look good. #debate08
"Barack Obama doesn't understand" and "I agree with John McCain" were the major repeated lines of the night -Cameron #debate08 #current
#debate08 mccain wins on passion. obama's 1, 2, 3ing was stilted. mccain sought to convince, obama was presenting logic.
#debate08 Acknowledging common ground with your opponent is not weakness.
Biden will step up to the plate and talk about the debate to Brian Williams, but where's Palin...? Oh, that's right, too cowardly #current
@Condoulo yes I like those Clinton policies, but you have yet to say what he actually did.
How can Obama bring up Palin ?  If he can, without looking mean, he can win #current #debate08
#current Ooh, the RNC spin: "Obama says we have to lose in Iraq in order to win in Afghanistan." according to Guilianni.
Loved that fact that Obama said McCain was correct so many times and McCain said Obama was clueless about issues #current #debate08
I want to see Obama more aggressive in the next debate. I know he has more of a fight in him. #current
Good point from a FOX News commentator: McCain's looking backward, Obama is looking forward. #current
Post #debate08 Senator Biden appears on NBC, Gov. Palin absent and Rudi Giullianni is filling in for her...strange indeed.
Obama said "John is right" at least 8 times! McCain on offense,Obama on defense. 21 Factcheck for BHO 16 for McCain #comment #debate08
obama wasn't concise enough and should've pushed 3rd bush term more, but he looked like a plausible CiC, which was top priority #tweetdebate
NPR Commentary: "A stalemate is a win for Obama as this is McCain's strongest point." ha.  Hadn't thought of it that way. #debate08
#debate08 #current On a recent falling out w/Ron Paul Barr:"We wanted to provide true focused leadership for the L.P." "R.P. did espouse"
#debate08 Obama appeared presidential vs McCain who acted liked a cranky old grandpa
#debate08 were was the spice? I expected more wrangling. None scripted.
#debate08 also, giulani is miles left (not nearly left enough though) of palin on almost every issue
#current #debate08 Neither did too great. Now the news bias spins off...Fox: McCain grand slam. CNN seems pretty even for now.
I would say it was 50/50 #debate08
notice that McCain didn't mention education, his healthcare plan other than keeping it private and taking care of nations children #current
: #debate08 Neither of them "won." Obama held his own, but was often defensive against McCain's digs. McCain swung from grumpy to bland.
#winner #current The debate result is much like how the poll results have been: somewhat close, leaning toward whichever guy you like.
giuliani lies. Obama will cut corporate loopholes. better plan than raising my taxes.  #debate08
obama may not have the experience mccain has, he does imho  have a plausible theory of what american foreign policy should be about #current
@current pavlicko Obama wasn't the one that almost didn't show up.
McCain did better than I thought he would tonight, but he did lie several times and his economic policy is ridiculous, now the VPs #debate08
McCain headed back to DC #current #debate
One thing that Obama had over McCain is that he turned and tried to engage McCain, McCain avoided all eye contact #current #tweetdebate
MCCAIN: How about a spending freeze on everything but defense, veteran affairs and entitlement programs. #DEBATE08
Most common statments tonight: Obama: "McCain is right"; McCain: "Obama doesn't understand". Points to McCain. #current
The transcripts are up people, let's get the facts straight and not add to the spin #DEBATE08
#current Both candidates gave very convincing party lines, but chats on Sun Times chat reveals Obama favored...McCain viewed as nervous
#debate08 OBAMA won!!! McCain looked like a condescending old man tonight!
#current Obama sounds better on the stump than in the debate
#current - visually, McCain won hands down.  You don't  put a dark-skinned person against a blue background, and you turn the lights up.
No matter who wins, we're headed for tough times. #tweetdebate
Nice that McCain tried to lead on Obama and he wouldnt take the bait. #debate08
Obama showed that he's calm under pressure, while McCain showed that he can't treat dissent as intelligent or reasoned.Obama wins! #debate08
@janoss - not once. Obama looked at McCain numerous times, addressed him directly at least nine times.
After the debates, Obama: Gentleman. McCain: A-hole. #current
Obama got away with pretending to be a sober, sensible centrist instead of the statist he is, and thus won the debate #debate08
#current McCain came off as the cranky, old man he is...er, old, white-haired dude
I wonder how long it will take the McSame camp to roll out their "John is right" Obama debate quote commercials? #debate08 #current
Obama=New Media King; all hype. McCain's team has been pumping out YouTube ads w HUGE off-line impact. Ie: http://snurl.com/3vlxx #debate08
#current #debate08 McCain didn't get very high highs, but his ratings with Independents looked fairly strong throughout, especially on #pork
@benpolitico Just saw you on CNN walking past Dana Bash and Nicole Wallace. #debate08 #current
@ButtaBaby they already have ads saying "McCain won!" #current
#current  Wow, the media works fast. http://tinyurl.com/43n74w ahahaha. epic. 
McCain already has an ad out from the debates. Damn that was fast http://tinyurl.com/49unmh #current
#debate08 I think it was a draw... maybe McCain a bit up but this is his issue!
#debate08 Obama said "McCain was right" eight times! McCain never spelled out that he agreed with Obama
And for all of you tweeters twittering over McCain's "Existential Threat" that was no error; literally: "A threat to existence" #current
#debate08 1st debate done & i still don't think i'm leaning either way. finger pointing & 1/2 truths on both sides. not much honesty imho
@janoss - Obama =total control over emotive... typical Lyndon Johnson "socialist." At the same time- I wonder how he won over "experience."
@tarheelcoxn re: earmarks, obama could've just asked him why he picked palin with all of hers. #debate08
#current Biden: What're ya gonna do economically and relative to the war? That's what it's all about.
@janoss - I would expect Obama to represent this country with dignity. Not so with McCain/Palin
#current Biden: Obama said in order to get economy moving again, you gotta help middle class. McCain wants to help out the billionaires.
@DocMara hopefully the GOP will select someone younger and eloquent vs Obama in 2012. I'd like to see that debate. #debate08

20% McCain;  75% Obama; remaining not sure-- predicted winner of debate according to MSNBC voters #current #tweetdebate
@Imarilove exploiting is what he knows and loves, methinks
#debate08 other big question: did McCain acknowledge that the US has tortured people in recent years? If so, that's major story....
#current Anderson to Wolf "don't hold your breath waiting for Palin to comment tonight" (laughter all around)
#debate08 my feelings are pretty much this... why JUST those two canidates? I thought there were more than two???
@cyn3matic McCain's tie looks fine in HD, but I hear it was aliasing like crazy on SD channels. #debate08
@Imarilove Yes!!! Obama has done more for veterans than McCain has DESPITE the fact that McCain's a former POW.
#debate08 biden/palin debate viewship will trump this one. Great odds biden gaffes like never before, or palin completely melts down
@etherkiller and when Obama tried to set his own record straight, McCain talked over him. Obama was the better man and stood down. #debate08
#debate08 some undecided woman on cnn just said that obama didn't stutter. maybe she wasn't watching the same debate i was...
In case anyone cares, Henry Kissinger just released a statement noting that Obama just doesn't know anything.  #current #debate08
@freeulysses that's what we do best... irrationallity #debate08
#2019 #current in other words those without a pick best understood the heart of the issues, but had little voice over the rally cries.
@korym I hope an iPhone will solve this issue. ;) Also: #debate08 is basically either 'OBAMA RAWK' or 'MCCAIN'S NEW AD: url'. Laaame.
McCain wasn't bad but he was attacking Obama more than actually taking a stand. Obama's positions became more clear.  Good #debate08
#2019 #current looking back on it now, I can't say that it made much of a difference to us now, unless the other guy cut GEAS funding.
Obama: McCain you're right.  McCain: Senator Obama just doesn't understand #current #debate08
#debate08 It scares me that people being polled still think McCain is better on military/veteran issues. Support the troops -- vote Obama!
you have to be a fast reader at http://election.twitter.com/ #debate08
#debate08, Obama will let anyone talk over top of him. Not very macho. McCain will kick ass & talk over top of all peoples/nations RNCFTW
#debate08 wtf is this McCain twitter banner next to barack's banner? http://twitter.com/JohnMcCain. Fake JM?!?
#debate08 Who won? It depends on the topic. McCain good on foreign policy. Obama on home turf/leadership. Looking for fact checks.
Collected my thoughts and I think mcain would do some stuff well. But Obama would do more, better. #current night
Joe Biden just dropped a brute steamer on McCain's face on MSNBC #debate08
@RobertBluey Well, then McCain needs to prove that he's head and shoulders above Obama on policy - Are you saying BO rope-a-doped?
y say its ok to 'tie' bc its the other guy's strength? foreign policy is NOT mccain's strength. why do we keep giving them ground? #debate08

I knew he would bring up his POW experience.  No disrespect,  but if that is all it takes, there's plenty of POW's in Guantanamo. #current
Breaking news: McCain campaign thinks he won #debate08. So far Obama has not yet declared victory, but that's surely coming.

#debate08 Yeah, why is it Biden vs. Guilani in the NBC after shock?
Fox calls it for McCain! In other news, snow is cold! #debate08
@BarbaraKB Who ever claimed that? Watching #current is good, I saw debate on ABC
#debate08 The CNN talking heads seem to give an edge to Obama. I'm not so sure. I thought Obama needed a knockout punch. Didn't happen.

The LHC may not have sucked the world into a black hole, but I'm less assured of the result when Palin debates next week #tweetdebate
#current Guess you gotta watch one of the big 3 for the big interviews. Biden on NBC. "John has no notion what to do now surge is over."
#debate08 listening to wrap up
McCain has more knowledge on international issues, but I'm still voting for Obama. #current
#debate08 Obama needs to focus on a single message - he raised to many good points. Keep it simple, keep it repetitive.  Marketing sells.
Ok, Harold Ford coming on.  Time to stop watching and make a drink.  TGIF!  #debate08
#debate08 For a debate in McCain's "wheelhouse," it's really bizarre that McCain couldn't look his opponent in the eye.  Bizarre.
#debate08 Biden vs. Guilani in the NBC after shock - where is Palin?... Palin declined, and the GOP offered Guilani.

#debate08 mccain spokeswoman on cnn just called obama "eloquent," haven't people learned not to do that yet
McCain needed to look more independent.  Now he looks to ride Obama's coattails with the "I agree" commercial.  #debate08 #mccain #obama
